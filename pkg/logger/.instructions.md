# Copilot Instructions for pkg/logger (nixai Project)

## Purpose
- This package implements all logging logic for the nixai project.
- It provides helpers, interfaces, and services for structured, leveled logging across all internal and CLI packages.
- It is used by all major components (AI, CLI, system, etc.) to ensure consistent, configurable logging.

## Coding Guidelines
- Use Go idioms and keep code modular and well-documented.
- Provide a logger interface and concrete implementations for different log levels (debug, info, warn, error).
- Respect the log level set in the configuration (see `internal/config`).
- Support output to stdout, stderr, and optionally to files or other sinks.
- Use clear, human-readable log formatting, and support structured logging if possible.
- Add or update tests for all new features and bugfixes.

## Features to Support
- Configurable log levels (debug, info, warn, error).
- Structured and colorized output for CLI readability.
- Integration with all major packages (AI, CLI, system, etc.).
- Helpers for logging errors, warnings, info, and debug messages.
- Testability: all helpers and logic must be covered by unit tests.

## Best Practices
- Keep logger logic isolated from business logic and CLI code.
- Use clear, descriptive names for all exported types and functions.
- Document all exported types and methods.
- Add examples and usage notes in code comments where helpful.
- Use context and error handling idiomatically.

## Testing
- All helpers and logic must have corresponding test files (e.g., `logger_test.go`).
- Test all log levels and output sinks.
- Test both success and error/failure scenarios.

## Integration Points
- Used by all internal and CLI packages for logging.
- Reads configuration from `internal/config` for log level and settings.
