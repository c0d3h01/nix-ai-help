# Copilot Instructions for pkg/utils (nixai Project)

## Purpose
- This package implements utility functions and formatting helpers for the nixai project.
- It provides reusable helpers for string manipulation, file checks, formatting terminal output, and other common operations.
- It is used by all major components (CLI, AI, system, etc.) to ensure consistent, readable, and maintainable code and output.

## Coding Guidelines
- Use Go idioms and keep code modular and well-documented.
- Keep formatting logic (headers, key-value, dividers, Markdown rendering, etc.) in `formatter.go`.
- Provide utility functions for file checks, string helpers, and other common needs in separate files as appropriate.
- All formatting for CLI output must use these helpers for consistency (e.g., `FormatHeader`, `FormatKeyValue`, `FormatDivider`, `RenderMarkdown`).
- Add or update tests for all new features and bugfixes.

## Features to Support
- Terminal output formatting: headers, key-value pairs, dividers, code blocks, lists, tips, notes, and Markdown rendering (using glamour).
- Utility functions for file existence, string manipulation, and other common tasks.
- Helpers for progress indicators, error/warning/info formatting, and success messages.
- Testability: all helpers and logic must be covered by unit tests.

## Best Practices
- Keep formatting and utility logic isolated from business logic and CLI code.
- Use clear, descriptive names for all exported types and functions.
- Document all exported types and methods.
- Add examples and usage notes in code comments where helpful.
- Use context and error handling idiomatically where relevant.

## Testing
- All helpers and logic must have corresponding test files (e.g., `formatter_test.go`, `utils_test.go`).
- Test all formatting styles and edge cases.
- Test both success and error/failure scenarios.

## Integration Points
- Used by all internal and CLI packages for formatting and utility operations.
- Formatting helpers are required for all CLI output to ensure a consistent user experience.
