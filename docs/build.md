nixai build status build-12345

# Stop a running build
nixai build stop build-12345
```

---

## Background Build Management

### üöÄ Background Builds
Start builds in background for long-running processes:

```sh
# Start firefox build in background
nixai build background firefox

# Background flake build
nixai build background .#myapp --flake
```

**Benefits:**

## Real-World Examples

### Basic Build Scenarios
```sh
# Simple package build with AI assistance
nixai build curl

# System rebuild with monitoring
nixai build --verbose

# Flake-based application build
nixai build .#myapp --flake
```

### Advanced Troubleshooting
```sh
# Debug failing Firefox build
nixai build debug firefox

# Analyze why builds aren't using cache
nixai build cache-miss

# Profile performance of complex build
nixai build profile --package nixos-system
```

### Production Workflows
```sh
# Start background build and monitor
nixai build background firefox
nixai build watch firefox

# Queue system rebuild with dependencies
nixai build queue system-config user-packages development-tools

# Monitor all active builds
nixai build status
```

### Emergency Recovery
```sh
# Intelligent retry of failed build
nixai build retry

# Debug sandbox issues preventing builds
nixai build sandbox-debug

# Quick performance check
nixai build profile --package failing-package
```

## Best Practices

### For Development
- Use `nixai build watch` for active development
- Profile builds regularly with `nixai build profile`
- Queue related packages with `nixai build queue`

### For Production
- Start critical builds with `nixai build background`
- Monitor build status with `nixai build status`
- Analyze cache performance periodically

### For Troubleshooting
- Always start with `nixai build debug <package>`
- Use `nixai build retry` for known issues
- Check sandbox with `nixai build sandbox-debug`
