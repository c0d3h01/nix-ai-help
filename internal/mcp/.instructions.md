# Copilot Instructions for internal/mcp (nixai Project)

## Purpose
- This package implements all logic related to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and documentation querying for the nixai project.
- It provides helpers, interfaces, and services for starting, stopping, querying, and managing the MCP server.
- It is used by the `mcp-server` command and by other packages (e.g., `internal/cli`, `internal/ai`) to access NixOS documentation from multiple sources.

## Coding Guidelines
- Use Go idioms and keep code modular and well-documented.
- Encapsulate MCP server logic in service structs and interfaces for testability and extensibility.
- Support starting, stopping, status checking, and querying the MCP server.
- Always use documentation sources defined in the configuration (see `internal/config`).
- Validate and sanitize all user input and external data sources.
- Add or update tests for all new features and bugfixes.
- Use `pkg/logger` for logging, respecting log level from config.
- Use `pkg/utils` for formatting and utility functions.

## Features to Support
- Starting, stopping, and checking the status of the MCP server.
- Querying NixOS documentation from multiple sources (wiki, manuals, home-manager, etc.).
- Graceful error handling and fallback if the MCP server is unavailable.
- Helpers for formatting and presenting documentation results in the CLI.
- Testability: all helpers and logic must be covered by unit tests.

## Best Practices
- Keep MCP server logic isolated from CLI code.
- Use clear, descriptive names for all exported types and functions.
- Document all exported types and methods.
- Add examples and usage notes in code comments where helpful.
- Use context and error handling idiomatically.

## Testing
- All helpers and logic must have corresponding test files (e.g., `mcp_test.go`).
- Mock external dependencies (HTTP, file system, network) in tests.
- Test both success and error/failure scenarios.

## Integration Points
- Used by CLI commands in `internal/cli` for the `mcp-server` command and documentation queries.
- Used by `internal/ai` for documentation-aware AI prompts.
- Reads configuration from `internal/config` for documentation sources and server settings.
- Logs to `pkg/logger`.
