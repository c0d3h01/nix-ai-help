# Copilot Instructions for internal/nixos (nixai Project)

## Purpose
- This package implements all logic related to NixOS system operations, diagnostics, log parsing, and command execution for the nixai project.
- It provides helpers, interfaces, and services for interacting with NixOS configurations, running system commands, parsing logs, and performing diagnostics.
- It is used by CLI commands (e.g., `diagnose`, `logs`, `search`, `explain-option`, etc.) to provide system-level features and troubleshooting.

## Coding Guidelines
- Use Go idioms and keep code modular and well-documented.
- Encapsulate NixOS system logic in service structs and interfaces for testability and extensibility.
- Support log parsing, diagnostics, and command execution (e.g., `nixos-rebuild`, `nix search`, etc.).
- Validate and sanitize all user input, file paths, and command arguments.
- Add or update tests for all new features and bugfixes.
- Use `pkg/logger` for logging, respecting log level from config.
- Use `pkg/utils` for formatting and utility functions.

## Features to Support
- Parsing and analyzing NixOS logs (from files or piped input).
- Running and parsing results from NixOS system commands.
- Diagnostics for configuration, build, and runtime issues.
- Helpers for extracting and formatting NixOS options and settings.
- CLI integration for commands like `diagnose`, `logs`, `search`, `explain-option`, etc.
- Testability: all helpers and logic must be covered by unit tests.

## Best Practices
- Keep system and diagnostic logic isolated from CLI code.
- Use clear, descriptive names for all exported types and functions.
- Document all exported types and methods.
- Add examples and usage notes in code comments where helpful.
- Use context and error handling idiomatically.

## Testing
- All helpers and logic must have corresponding test files (e.g., `nixos_test.go`).
- Mock external dependencies (system commands, file system) in tests.
- Test both success and error/failure scenarios.

## Integration Points
- Used by CLI commands in `internal/cli` for system operations, diagnostics, and log analysis.
- Reads configuration from `internal/config` if needed.
- Logs to `pkg/logger`.
