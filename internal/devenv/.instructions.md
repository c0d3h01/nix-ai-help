# Copilot Instructions for internal/devenv (nixai Project)

## Purpose
- This package implements all logic related to development environment (devenv) management for the nixai project.
- It provides helpers, interfaces, and services for creating, suggesting, and managing Nix-based development environments via the CLI.
- It is used by the `devenv` command and related subcommands in the CLI to automate and enhance developer workflows.

## Coding Guidelines
- Use Go idioms and keep code modular and well-documented.
- Encapsulate devenv logic in service structs and interfaces for testability and extensibility.
- Support AI-powered template suggestion and project analysis using the `internal/ai` package.
- Integrate with NixOS and flake-based workflows where possible.
- Validate and sanitize all user input and file paths.
- Add or update tests for all new features and bugfixes.
- Use `pkg/logger` for logging, respecting log level from config.
- Use `pkg/utils` for formatting and utility functions.

## Features to Support
- Creation and management of Nix-based development environments (devenv.nix, flake.nix, etc.).
- AI-powered template suggestion and project analysis.
- Helpers for generating, validating, and customizing devenv files.
- CLI integration for commands like `devenv suggest`, `devenv create`, etc.
- Testability: all helpers and logic must be covered by unit tests.

## Best Practices
- Keep template and environment logic isolated from CLI code.
- Use clear, descriptive names for all exported types and functions.
- Document all exported types and methods.
- Add examples and usage notes in code comments where helpful.
- Use context and error handling idiomatically.

## Testing
- All helpers and logic must have corresponding test files (e.g., `devenv_test.go`).
- Mock external dependencies (AI, file system) in tests.
- Test both success and error/failure scenarios.

## Integration Points
- Used by CLI commands in `internal/cli` for the `devenv` command and related features.
- Integrates with `internal/ai` for template suggestion and analysis.
- Reads configuration from `internal/config`.
- Logs to `pkg/logger`.
