# Copilot Instructions for internal/machines (nixai Project)

## Purpose
- This package implements all logic related to NixOS machine management, multi-host orchestration, and configuration synchronization for the nixai project.
- It provides helpers, interfaces, and services for listing, managing, and synchronizing multiple NixOS machines via the CLI.
- It is used by the `machines` command and related subcommands in the CLI to automate and enhance multi-machine workflows.

## Coding Guidelines
- Use Go idioms and keep code modular and well-documented.
- Encapsulate machine management logic in service structs and interfaces for testability and extensibility.
- Support both local and remote machine management (e.g., SSH, flake-based sync, etc.).
- Validate and sanitize all user input, hostnames, and file paths.
- Add or update tests for all new features and bugfixes.
- Use `pkg/logger` for logging, respecting log level from config.
- Use `pkg/utils` for formatting and utility functions.

## Features to Support
- Listing and describing NixOS machines managed by nixai.
- Synchronizing configurations across multiple hosts.
- Helpers for adding, removing, and updating machine definitions.
- CLI integration for commands like `machines list`, `machines sync`, `machines add`, etc.
- Testability: all helpers and logic must be covered by unit tests.

## Best Practices
- Keep machine management logic isolated from CLI code.
- Use clear, descriptive names for all exported types and functions.
- Document all exported types and methods.
- Add examples and usage notes in code comments where helpful.
- Use context and error handling idiomatically.

## Testing
- All helpers and logic must have corresponding test files (e.g., `machines_test.go`).
- Mock external dependencies (SSH, file system, network) in tests.
- Test both success and error/failure scenarios.

## Integration Points
- Used by CLI commands in `internal/cli` for the `machines` command and related features.
- Reads configuration from `internal/config` if needed.
- Logs to `pkg/logger`.
