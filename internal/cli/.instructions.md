# Copilot Instructions for the nixai Project (CLI Submodule)

## Project Purpose
- nixai is a modular, console-based Linux application for solving NixOS configuration problems and assisting with NixOS setup, management, and troubleshooting from the command line.
- Supports direct AI-powered help via `nixai "question"` or `nixai --ask "question"`.
- Integrates multiple LLMs (Ollama, Gemini, OpenAI, etc.), defaulting to local Ollama for privacy, with user-selectable providers and fallback.
- Leverages an MCP server to query NixOS documentation from multiple official and community sources.
- Parses log outputs, accepts piped logs, executes and diagnoses local NixOS commands, and supports both interactive and CLI-driven workflows.
- Modular submodules for community, packaging, learning, devenv, neovim, machines, and more.

## Coding Guidelines
- Use idiomatic Go and modular design for all code.
- All configuration is loaded from YAML (see `configs/default.yaml`) via the `internal/config` package.
- Use `internal/ai` for all LLM interactions. All providers must implement both `Query` and `GenerateResponse` methods. Allow user/provider selection and fallback.
- Use `internal/mcp` for documentation queries, always using sources from config.
- Use `internal/nixos` for log parsing, diagnostics, and NixOS command execution.
- Use `pkg/logger` for all logging, respecting log level from config.
- Use `pkg/utils` for utility functions (file checks, string helpers, formatting, etc.).
- All CLI commands and interactive logic must be in `internal/cli` using the cobra framework. Each submodule may have its own Copilot instructions.
- Main entrypoint: `cmd/nixai/main.go`.
- All new features must be testable and documented.

## Features to Support
- **Direct Question Assistant**: Answer questions via `nixai "question"` or `--ask`/`-a` flag, using the provider's `Query` method.
- **Log & Config Diagnostics**: Diagnose NixOS issues from logs, configs, or piped input using LLMs.
- **Documentation Query**: Query NixOS docs from multiple official and community sources (see config).
- **NixOS Command Execution**: Run and parse local NixOS commands.
- **AI Provider Selection**: User can select/configure AI provider (Ollama, Gemini, OpenAI, etc.).
- **Package Repository Analysis**: Analyze Git repos and generate Nix derivations with `package-repo` command.
- **NixOS Option Explainer**: Explain NixOS options with `explain-option` command.
- **Home Manager Option Support**: Explain Home Manager options with `explain-home-option` command.
- **Community, Learning, Devenv, Machines, Neovim**: Modular commands for each area, each with its own help menu and Copilot instructions.
- **CLI Help Menus**: All commands must provide clear, formatted, actionable help menus with examples.
- **Interactive & Piped Input**: Accept logs/configs via pipe or file for analysis.
- **Progress Indicators**: Show progress during API calls and long operations.
- **Templates & Snippets**: Manage and apply configuration templates/snippets with `nixai templates` and `nixai snippets`.
- **Multi-Machine Management**: Manage and deploy to multiple hosts using flake-based configs with `nixai machines`.
- **Neovim & VS Code Integration**: Support for editor integration setup and troubleshooting.
- **Migration Assistant**: Channel ↔ Flake migration with backup, validation, and AI-powered guidance.
- **Store Management**: Backup, restore, verify, and analyze the Nix store from the CLI.

## CLI Command Guidelines
- Use the cobra framework for all CLI commands.
- Follow the `cmd/subcommand/action` structure.
- Each command must have proper help text, examples, and flag descriptions.
- Use consistent flag names (e.g., `--nixos-path`, `--dry-run`, `--verbose`).
- Use `utils.FormatHeader`, `utils.FormatKeyValue`, `utils.FormatDivider`, and other formatting utilities for output.
- Use glamour for Markdown rendering with proper syntax highlighting.
- Show progress indicators for API calls and long-running operations.
- Use emojis for visual appeal and section headers.
- Provide actionable error messages using `utils.FormatError`.
- Validate and sanitize all user input and log data.
- Gracefully handle EOF, interrupts, and unavailable services (AI, MCP, etc.).
- Support both CLI and interactive mode for all commands.
- All commands must be reflected in help menus and documentation.

## Testing & Build
- Use the `justfile` for build, test, lint, and run tasks.
- Use Nix (`flake.nix`) for reproducible builds and dev environments.
- All features must be covered by tests; update or add tests as needed.
- Include unit, integration, and interactive mode tests for all commands.
- Mock external dependencies (AI providers, MCP server, file system) in tests.

## Documentation
- Update `README.md` and `docs/MANUAL.md` for all new features, commands, and changes.
- Document both direct question and flag-based interfaces, with examples in README and manual.
- Each submodule should have its own Copilot instructions reflecting its responsibilities and integration points.
- Keep this instruction file up to date as the project evolves.

## AI Provider Integration
- All providers (Ollama, Gemini, OpenAI, etc.) must implement both `Query` and `GenerateResponse` methods.
- Default to Ollama with `llama3` model if not specified.
- Format prompts consistently across providers.
- API keys must be kept in environment variables, never in config files.

## Terminal UI
- Use formatting utilities for headers, key-value pairs, and dividers.
- Use glamour for Markdown rendering.
- Show progress indicators for long operations.
- Use consistent terminology and helpful examples in command help.
- Use beautiful, colorized output for all user-facing text.

## Best Practices
1. **Consistency:** Follow existing patterns for command structure and naming.
2. **Documentation:** Include comprehensive help text and examples for every command.
3. **Error Handling:** Provide actionable error messages.
4. **Progress Feedback:** Show progress for operations that take time.
5. **Graceful Degradation:** Handle missing dependencies gracefully.
6. **Security:** Validate and sanitize all user input.
7. **Testing:** Write comprehensive tests for all command functionality.
8. **Accessibility:** Use clear, readable output formatting.

## Integration Points
- **AI Providers:** Use `internal/ai` for all AI interactions.
- **Configuration:** Use `internal/config` for configuration management.
- **NixOS Integration:** Use `internal/nixos` for system operations.
- **MCP Server:** Use `internal/mcp` for documentation queries.
- **Logging:** Use `pkg/logger` for all logging operations.
- **Utilities:** Use `pkg/utils` for common operations.

> These instructions are for all Copilot models and contributors. Follow them to ensure consistency, maintainability, and feature completeness for the nixai project. All submodules must have their own up-to-date `.instructions.md` files. When answering questions about frameworks, libraries, or APIs, use Context7 to retrieve current documentation rather than relying on training data.
