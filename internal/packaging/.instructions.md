# Copilot Instructions for internal/packaging (nixai Project)

## Purpose
- This package implements all logic related to packaging, Nix derivation generation, and repository analysis for the nixai project.
- It provides helpers, interfaces, and services for analyzing Git repositories, generating Nix expressions, and automating packaging workflows.
- It is used by the `package-repo` command and related subcommands in the CLI to help users package software and automate Nix expressions for projects.

## Coding Guidelines
- Use Go idioms and keep code modular and well-documented.
- Encapsulate packaging logic in service structs and interfaces for testability and extensibility.
- Support both remote (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) and local repository analysis.
- Validate and sanitize all user input, URLs, and file paths.
- Add or update tests for all new features and bugfixes.
- Use `pkg/logger` for logging, respecting log level from config.
- Use `pkg/utils` for formatting and utility functions.

## Features to Support
- Analyzing Git repositories (remote and local) to extract build and dependency information.
- Generating Nix derivations and expressions for packaged projects.
- CLI integration for commands like `package-repo <url>`, `package-repo --analyze <dir>`, `package-repo --output <file>`, etc.
- Helpers for customizing and validating generated Nix expressions.
- Testability: all helpers and logic must be covered by unit tests.

## Best Practices
- Keep packaging and derivation logic isolated from CLI code.
- Use clear, descriptive names for all exported types and functions.
- Document all exported types and methods.
- Add examples and usage notes in code comments where helpful.
- Use context and error handling idiomatically.

## Testing
- All helpers and logic must have corresponding test files (e.g., `packaging_test.go`).
- Mock external dependencies (Git, file system, network) in tests.
- Test both success and error/failure scenarios.

## Integration Points
- Used by CLI commands in `internal/cli` for the `package-repo` command and related features.
- Reads configuration from `internal/config` if needed.
- Logs to `pkg/logger`.
