# Copilot Instructions for internal/learning (nixai Project)

## Purpose
- This package implements all logic related to NixOS learning, tutorials, and training modules for the nixai project.
- It provides helpers, interfaces, and services for interactive and CLI-based learning experiences (e.g., tutorials, quizzes, troubleshooting exercises).
- It is used by the `learn` command and related subcommands in the CLI to help users improve their NixOS skills.

## Coding Guidelines
- Use Go idioms and keep code modular and well-documented.
- Encapsulate learning logic in service structs and interfaces for testability and extensibility.
- Support both interactive and non-interactive (CLI) learning flows.
- Validate and sanitize all user input and file paths.
- Add or update tests for all new features and bugfixes.
- Use `pkg/logger` for logging, respecting log level from config.
- Use `pkg/utils` for formatting and utility functions.

## Features to Support
- Interactive and CLI-based tutorials for NixOS basics, advanced usage, troubleshooting, and quizzes.
- Helpers for generating, validating, and presenting learning modules.
- CLI integration for commands like `learn basics`, `learn advanced`, `learn troubleshooting`, `learn quiz`, etc.
- Testability: all helpers and logic must be covered by unit tests.

## Best Practices
- Keep learning module logic isolated from CLI code.
- Use clear, descriptive names for all exported types and functions.
- Document all exported types and methods.
- Add examples and usage notes in code comments where helpful.
- Use context and error handling idiomatically.

## Testing
- All helpers and logic must have corresponding test files (e.g., `learning_test.go`).
- Mock external dependencies (AI, file system) in tests.
- Test both success and error/failure scenarios.

## Integration Points
- Used by CLI commands in `internal/cli` for the `learn` command and related features.
- May integrate with `internal/ai` for AI-powered learning modules in the future.
- Reads configuration from `internal/config` if needed.
- Logs to `pkg/logger`.
