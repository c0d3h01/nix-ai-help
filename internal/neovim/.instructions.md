# Copilot Instructions for internal/neovim (nixai Project)

## Purpose
- This package implements all logic related to Neovim integration and setup for the nixai project.
- It provides helpers, interfaces, and services for installing, configuring, and checking Neovim integration with NixOS and nixai.
- It is used by the `neovim-setup` command and related subcommands in the CLI to automate and enhance Neovim workflows for NixOS users.

## Coding Guidelines
- Use Go idioms and keep code modular and well-documented.
- Encapsulate Neovim integration logic in service structs and interfaces for testability and extensibility.
- Support installation, configuration, and status checking of Neovim and recommended plugins.
- Validate and sanitize all user input and file paths.
- Add or update tests for all new features and bugfixes.
- Use `pkg/logger` for logging, respecting log level from config.
- Use `pkg/utils` for formatting and utility functions.

## Features to Support
- Installing Neovim and recommended plugins for NixOS development.
- Configuring Neovim for optimal integration with NixOS and nixai.
- Checking and reporting Neovim integration status.
- CLI integration for commands like `neovim-setup install`, `neovim-setup configure`, `neovim-setup check`, etc.
- Testability: all helpers and logic must be covered by unit tests.

## Best Practices
- Keep Neovim integration logic isolated from CLI code.
- Use clear, descriptive names for all exported types and functions.
- Document all exported types and methods.
- Add examples and usage notes in code comments where helpful.
- Use context and error handling idiomatically.

## Testing
- All helpers and logic must have corresponding test files (e.g., `neovim_test.go`).
- Mock external dependencies (file system, shell, Neovim binary) in tests.
- Test both success and error/failure scenarios.

## Integration Points
- Used by CLI commands in `internal/cli` for the `neovim-setup` command and related features.
- Reads configuration from `internal/config` if needed.
- Logs to `pkg/logger`.
