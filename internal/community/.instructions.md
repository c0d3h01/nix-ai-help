# Copilot Instructions for internal/community (nixai Project)

## Purpose
- This package implements all logic related to NixOS community resources and integration for the nixai project.
- It provides data, helpers, and interfaces for surfacing community forums, documentation, chat channels, GitHub resources, and other collaborative features in the CLI.
- It is used by the `community` command in the CLI to present up-to-date, actionable community information to users.

## Coding Guidelines
- Use Go idioms and keep code modular and well-documented.
- Store community resource definitions (forums, docs, chat, etc.) in a structured, extensible way (e.g., structs, maps, or config files).
- Provide helper functions for formatting and displaying community resources in the CLI.
- All output formatting should use utilities from `pkg/utils` for consistency.
- Add or update tests for all new features and bugfixes.
- Validate and sanitize any user input or external data sources.

## Features to Support
- Centralized definitions for NixOS community resources (forums, docs, Matrix, GitHub, etc.).
- Helper functions for rendering community menus and tips in the CLI.
- Support for future expansion (e.g., trending topics, user-contributed links, ratings).
- Testability: all helpers and logic must be covered by unit tests.

## Best Practices
- Keep resource lists up to date and easy to extend.
- Use clear, descriptive names for all exported types and functions.
- Document all exported types and methods.
- Use `pkg/logger` for logging if needed, respecting log level from config.
- Add examples and usage notes in code comments where helpful.

## Testing
- All helpers and logic must have corresponding test files (e.g., `community_test.go`).
- Test both success and error/failure scenarios.

## Integration Points
- Used by CLI commands in `internal/cli` for the `community` command and related features.
- May read configuration from `internal/config` if community resources become user-configurable.
- Logs to `pkg/logger` if needed.
